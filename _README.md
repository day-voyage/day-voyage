Diagram of architecture goes here

## Unstacking the stack

React
- modular and reusable components making it easy to compose different views
- Single Page Application with client side routing (challenge)
-
Redux - talk flux architecture, helped manage complexity over large application
- state management allowing a single source of truth for props shared throughout app
- reducers, store and actions - helps separate concerns
- what each does and how specifically it helped

Node
- event loop

Express
- server side routing

Webpack


## API's
