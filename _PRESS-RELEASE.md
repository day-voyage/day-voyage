There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows.

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.

    GoodTimes - let them roll

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.

   For locals and travelers to build and share custom plans of fun things to do around town.

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.

    GoodTimes lets you find and share fun things to do. Build custom plans to fill up a fun afternoon or night out. Share with friends so that you are all on the same page without the hassle of a constant stream of texts. Save plans to share with those friends of yours coming in from out of town, or even the GoodTimes community.

    On a budget? GoodTimes can help you tailor your plans to meet that ever so hard to meet budget.

    Bar hop polk street, hippies and vintage on haight, or live music at that hidden neighborhoood gem. What are you in the mood for?

   <!-- Let your friends their ideas so you don't have to do all the planning.  -->

## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.

    People are always looking for fun times to be had and an easy way to keep their friends in the loop about what's happening. Ever do something fun and tell an acquantance that they should totally do this because it was so fun. Well, now you have an easy way to share.

    Expensive cities can be tough to find fun things to do that will keep you under budget.

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.

    Whether you are coming in from out of town to explore a new city, or a local looking for something off the beaten path, GoodTimes is an event oriented application aimed at sharing plans. Users can build plans from acitivites provided by the application. Additionally, users can create custom activities to include within a larger itinerary of events. These plans can then be easily shared with friends, or the community at large so that others can share in the fun.

    Not only that, get some useful information about how much that fun time may lighten your wallet so nobody is surprised when the bill comes.

## Quote from You ##
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.

      Let the good times roll.

## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.

      Come see that totally fun thing you could do right now.

## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.

    I was planning a meet up with some of my girlfriends for a day in the city. GoodTimes let me look for things we all wanted to do and keep that all organized for us in one place. Dinner in Hayes Valley (who knew?) then dancing on Folsom. It was a night to remember.

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.

    What good times are you missing out on?
